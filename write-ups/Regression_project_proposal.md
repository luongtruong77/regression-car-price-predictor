# Regression Project Proposal

- In this project, I would like to build the regression model to predict the car's price based on its attributes and features.
- This model will provide the necessary tool for individuals who want to buy or sell a car but have no-to-little knowledge about the market or the automotive industry. Specifically, with enough information, the model will spit out the car's price (+/- error in an acceptable range).
- For the data, I will scrape from `cars.com` using `BeautifulSoup`.
- The **features** that would likely be important and expected to play roles in the model are `Mileage, Rating, City MPG, Highway MPG, Drivetrain, Transmission`. Besides, I will investigate and engineer from the original dataset more features such as `Vehicle Year, Entertainment, Safety` to see if they play any role in the model.
- The target will be the `Price` (in US dollar).
- Tools:
    - BeautifulSoup
    - Pandas
    - Seaborn
    - Selenium
    - Matplotlib
    - Scikit-learn
- Algorithms (planning):
    - Linear Regression
    - Regularized Linear Models (Ridge Reg, Lasso Reg)
    - Ensemble (RandomForest, GradientBoosting)
